# SC1015 Project - Saving Mall X
## Mall X
Mall X is one of the oldest most established malls in Singapore who has constantly been ranked as Singapore's highest earning shopping mall. 
However, when the pandemic struck, sales fell and Mall X was overtaken by its rival, Mall Y. Seeking to reclaim its title of highest earning shopping mall, the marketing team was tasked to devise strategies to increase sales.

Taking on the role of data analysts in the marketing team, we decided to enhance existing advertisements to attract greater sales. To do this, we performed a customer segmentation analysis on the mall's existing data of its customers.
